# Memory Discipline

You are coding inside a repository that has a hoangsa-memory memory server attached
via MCP. That server gives you four things you MUST use before taking any
load-bearing action:

1. **Indexed code graph** — via `memory_recall` (hybrid BM25 + symbol +
   vector search over the tree).
2. **User preferences** — `.hoangsa/memory/USER.md`, first-person style + workflow
   choices that apply across projects.
3. **Project facts** — `.hoangsa/memory/MEMORY.md`, durable invariants about this
   codebase.
4. **Reflective lessons** — `.hoangsa/memory/LESSONS.md`, action-triggered advice.

USER.md + MEMORY.md + LESSONS.md are injected verbatim at SessionStart, so
you already have them in context. The `memory_recall` hit extends that with
relevant code chunks.

Skipping this loop causes drift. Past sessions spent hours fixing
hallucinated APIs, re-learning patterns already documented in LESSONS.md,
or refactoring against conventions they never checked. Don't repeat them.

## The loop

Run this before writing code or asserting a non-obvious fact:

### 1. Recall

Call `memory_recall` with a query derived from the user's intent. If the
intent is "add a retry wrapper around the HTTP client", recall
`"http client retry"`. Prefer nouns from the user's request over verbs.

Read the returned chunks. Every chunk has a `path:line-span` you can cite.

### 2. Honour USER.md + LESSONS.md

USER.md and LESSONS.md were already injected at SessionStart. Before
acting, scan them for:

- **USER.md** entries that shape HOW you respond (tone, language, commit
  style, testing preferences). Apply them without being asked.
- **LESSONS.md** triggers that match your planned action. Restate the
  relevant lessons before proceeding — if a lesson advises against your
  plan, stop and ask the user.

### 3. Act

Proceed only after honouring preferences + lessons. If you edit code,
quote the recalled chunk ids you relied on.

### 4. Reflect

After the action completes (tests pass/fail, file saved, command run),
decide what to persist. Three surfaces, three tools:

- **Preference** (`memory_remember_preference`) — first-person, stable
  across projects ("user prefers Vietnamese responses", "user runs
  `make test` not `cargo test`"). Writes to USER.md.
- **Fact** (`memory_remember_fact`) — project-specific invariant
  ("HTTP retry lives in crates/net/retry.rs"). Writes to MEMORY.md.
- **Lesson** (`memory_remember_lesson`) — action-triggered advice
  ("when adding a retry → use RetryPolicy, not reqwest middleware").
  Writes to LESSONS.md.

Be conservative — only save memory that is specific, durable, and
non-obvious.

If the outcome was a success that validates a lesson you followed, call
`memory_lesson_outcome { signal: "success", triggers: [...] }` with the
triggers of the lessons you honoured. On failure, call it with
`signal: "failure"`. This bumps confidence counters so stale advice
eventually dies.

## Handling `cap_exceeded`

All three `remember_*` tools return a structured error when the write
would exceed `[memory].cap_*_bytes`. The error JSON has this shape:

```json
{
  "code": "cap_exceeded",
  "kind": "fact",
  "current_bytes": 13784,
  "cap_bytes": 16384,
  "attempted_bytes": 14200,
  "hint": "Call memory_replace or memory_remove to free space, then retry.",
  "preview": [
    {"index": 0, "first_line": "...", "bytes": 396, "tags": [...]}
  ]
}
```

When you see this, do NOT append to a sibling file or silently drop the
new memory. Instead:

1. Read the `preview` list. Each entry has `index`, `first_line`, and
   `bytes`.
2. Pick the entry(s) to consolidate or drop — prefer dropping stale
   session-handoff / bare-SHA / outdated entries over real invariants.
3. Call `memory_replace { kind, query, new_text }` to consolidate
   (merges the new memory into an existing entry), or
   `memory_remove { kind, query }` to free space outright.
4. Retry the original `remember_*` call.

For bulk cleanup of a legacy MEMORY.md / LESSONS.md that accumulated
pre-cap entries, run `hoangsa-memory memory migrate --llm` from the shell —
classifier triages every entry as keep / move-to-USER.md / drop, then
applies via the same replace/remove verbs.

## Anti-hallucination rules

- **Never assert a name, signature, or behaviour without a recall hit.**
  If `memory_recall` returns nothing relevant, say so explicitly: "I can't
  find that in the indexed code — can you point me at it?"
- **Quote chunk ids.** Citations look like `[chunk-id]` in your answer;
  the hoangsa-memory server uses them to validate that you grounded the response.
- **Bail on deny.** If a LESSONS.md trigger applies and the advice is
  "don't do X", and your plan is X, stop and ask the user.

## When NOT to run the loop

Skip the loop only for:

- pure conversation (no tool calls),
- read-only questions about files the user explicitly pasted,
- trivial one-line comment or typo fixes.

For everything else, run the loop. It takes ~5 seconds of tool calls and
saves hours of rework.

## Configuration

Live knobs in `<root>/config.toml`:

`[curation]` (legacy alias: `[discipline]`):
- `memory_mode = "auto"` (default) or `"review"`. See below.
- `grounding_check = false` — opt-in; adds the `memory.grounding_check`
  prompt to the MCP catalog.
- `quarantine_failure_ratio = 0.66` / `quarantine_min_attempts = 5` —
  thresholds the forget pass uses to quarantine bad lessons.

`[memory]`:
- `cap_memory_bytes = 16384` — hard cap for MEMORY.md.
- `cap_user_bytes = 4096` — hard cap for USER.md.
- `cap_lessons_bytes = 16384` — hard cap for LESSONS.md.
- `strict_content_policy = false` — when true, ephemeral-looking inputs
  (session-handoff prose, bare SHAs, date-only entries) are rejected at
  the `remember_*` entry point instead of just warning.

PreToolUse gating is handled by `hoangsa-cli hook enforce` against
`.hoangsa/rules.json` and `.hoangsa/state/enforcement.events` — see the
`hoangsa-cli rule` docs, not this file.

## Memory modes: `auto` vs `review`

When you call `memory_remember_*`, the server honours `memory_mode`:

- **`auto`** — the entry is appended straight to its target file.
  Fastest. Relies on the forget pass + confidence counters to prune bad
  memory later. Good for solo use.
- **`review`** — the entry is appended to a `*.pending.md` sibling. The
  user must run `hoangsa-memory memory promote <kind> <index>` (or call
  `memory_promote`) to accept. Rejected entries are archived with
  a reason in `memory-history.jsonl`. Good for teams.

Even in `auto` mode, the server refuses to silently **overwrite** an
existing lesson — if a `trigger` already exists, the new lesson is
staged and flagged with `"conflict": {...}` in the tool output. When you
see a conflict, do NOT try to auto-promote: flag it to the user via
`memory_request_review` and let them decide.

## Audit log

Every memory mutation lands in `.hoangsa/memory/memory-history.jsonl` (one JSON
per line) with `op`, `kind`, `title`, `actor`, `reason`, and a timestamp.
Ops include: `append`, `replace`, `remove`, `stage`, `promote`, `reject`,
`quarantine`, `propose`, `request_review`. Inspect with
`hoangsa-memory memory log --limit 50`. This log is size-capped and
self-truncates — old entries past the session window are intentionally
shed since reflection debt counts from `.session-start` anyway.

## Proposing new skills

When you've hit the same pattern in ≥5 lessons, consolidate them into a
reusable skill via `memory_skill_propose`:

- `slug`: kebab-case directory name.
- `body`: full SKILL.md text starting with `---\nname: ...` frontmatter.
- `source_triggers`: the triggers of the lessons being consolidated.

The draft lands at `.hoangsa/memory/skills/<slug>.draft/SKILL.md` and an entry is
written to the history log. The user promotes the draft via `hoangsa-memory
skills install .hoangsa/memory/skills/<slug>.draft` once they've reviewed it.

Drafts are NOT auto-installed — a human must review before a proposed
skill starts shaping future sessions. This is the main guardrail against
runaway self-modification.

## Why the gate exists

Prompts alone are bypassable — a self-confident agent can talk itself
into skipping the recall step. The gate is implemented by
`hoangsa-cli hook enforce`: it reads `.hoangsa/rules.json` (block / warn
rules) plus `.hoangsa/state/enforcement.events` (stateful checks such as
`require-memory-impact`) and replies `{"decision": "block", ...}` when a
mutation tool call is missing a prerequisite. The block response tells
you exactly what to call first — obey it instead of retrying blind.
